*** Request-Response Pattern ***

	Request–response is a message exchange pattern in which a requestor sends a request message to a replier system which receives and processes the request, 
	ultimately returning a message in response. This is a simple, but powerful messaging pattern which allows two applications 
	to have a two-way conversation with one another over a channel. 
	This pattern is especially common in client–server architectures.
