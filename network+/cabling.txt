COAXIAL 

    * Dates back to WWII
    * Composition
        * COPPER CONDUCTOR
        * INSULATION 
        * SECOND CONDUCTOR 
        * PVC Case 
    * RG Rating (Radio Grade)
        * RG-58 - 50ohm rating. One of the oldest types used in networking. BNC connector. 
        * RG-59 - 75ohm rating. Threaded connector - F-Type.
        * RG-6 - 75ohm. Most common. Thicker than RG-59. Threaded F-Type connector.

TWISTED PAIR 

    * Created in the late 60s for phones
    * Most common is Unshielded Twisted Pair - which lacks any external shielding.
    * Networking typically uses 4 pair cables 
    * Standards
        * 568A
            * 8 - Brown 
            * 7 - Brown/White 
            * 6 - Orange 
            * 5 - Blue/White 
            * 4 - Blue 
            * 3 - Orange White 
            * 2 - Green 
            * 1 - Green/White 
        * 568B
            * 8 - Brown 
            * 7 - Brown/White 
            * 6 - Green 
            * 5 - Blue/White 
            * 4 - Blue 
            * 3 - Green/White 
            * 2 - Orange 
            * 1 - Orange/White 
    * Solid core or Stranded core 
    * Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) - fully shielded for situations where inteferance is a concern 

CAT RATING 

    * CAT 3 - 10 Mbps 
    * CAT 5 - 100 Mbps @ 100m
    * CAT 5E - 1000 Mbps @ 100m
    * CAT 6 - 1 Gbps @ 100m
    * CAT 6a - 10 Gbps @ 100m
    * CAT 7 - 10 Gbps @ 100m - fully shielded 

FIBER-OPTICS

    * Composition 
        * Core 
        * Cladding
        * Jacket 
    * Multi-mode - 2 connectors. uses LED to transmit light. ORANGE 
    * Single-mode - 2 connectors. uses lasers for longer distances. YELLOW 
    * Duplex cables
    * Connectors 
        * ST connector - one of the earliest connectors. Round. Similar to a BNC.
        * SC connector - square.
        * FC connector - round but threaded.
        * LC connector - two connectors in one. smaller footprint. 
        * MT-RJ - smallest footprint. two connectors in one. 
    * Polishing
        * Physical Contact (PC) - slightly rounded 
        * Ultra Physical Contact (UPC) - more rounded 
        * Angled Physical Contact (APC) - angled cut 

FIRE RATINGS

    * Plenum-rated - space between drop ceiling and actual ceiling or gap in a raised floor. highest fire rating.
    * Riser-rated - run between floors in a building. lower fire rating.
    * PVC or Non-Plenum-rated - no fire protection. 

LEGACY CONNECTIONS 

    * Serial Ports - RS-232 protocol. DB9 or DB25 connection.
    * Parallel Ports - IEEE 1284. DB25 connection. Typically used for printing.
