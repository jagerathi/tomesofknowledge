=== FRAMES ===

Frames and Packets are often interchanged incorrectly. Frames encapsulate Packets with transport details. 

Packetized Data - cornerstone of networking 

Frame = 1,500 bytes 

Frames are created and destroyed within the NIC 


Frame Composition

    * Destination MAC 
    * Source MAC
    * Destination IP
    * Source IP 
    * Destination Port 
    * Source Port 
    * Data 
    * Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)

Frame will change during transmission, but the IP packet does not change
