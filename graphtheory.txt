=== GRAPH THEORY ===

Graph Theory is the mathematical theory of the properties and applications 
of graphs (networks). 

*** Types of Graphs ***

    * Undirected Graph - edges have no orientation (u,v) = (v,u) 
    * Directed Graph (digraph) - edges are directional (u,v) != (v,u)
    * Weighted Graphs - edges have weighted values (u,v,w)
    * Trees - undirected graph with no cycles 
    * Rooted Tree - has a root node. all nodes go in or out of root (in-tree or out-tree)
    * Directed Acyclic Graphs (DADS) - directed graph with no cycles 
    * Bipartite Graph - vertices can be split into two independent groups U and V 
    * Complete Graph - A unique edge between every pair of nodes (worst case)

*** Representations ***

    * Adjacency matrix (2D)
        PROS                                        CONS 
        Space efficient                             Requires O(v^2) space  
        Edge weight lookup is O(1)                  Iterating over all edges takes O(v^2) time 
        Simplest graph representation 

    * Adjancency List 
        A => [ (B,2), (C,4), (D,-2)]
        B => [ (A,2), (C,3), (D,1) ]
        PROS                                        CONS
        Space efficient for sparse graphs           Less space effiect for denser graphs 
        Iterating over all edges is efficient       Edge weight lookup is O(E) 
                                                    Slightly more complex graph representation 

    * Edge List (unordered list of edges - (U,V,W))
        [(C,A,4), (A,C,1),
         (B,C,6), (A,B,4),
         (C,B,1), (C,D,2) ]

        PROS                                        CONS
        Space efficient for sparse graphs           Less space efficient for denser graphs 
        Iterating over all edges is efficient       Edge weight lookup is O(E)
        Very simple structure 

*** Common Graph Theory Problems ***

    Questions:
        Is the graph directed or undirected?
        Are the edges of the graph weighted?
        Is the graph I will encounter likely to be sparse or dense with edges?
        Should I use an adjancency matrix, adjancency list, edge list, or other structure to represent efficiently?

    ** Shortest Path Problem **

    Algorithms:
        BFS 
        Dijkstra's 
        Bellman-Ford 
        Floyd-Warshall
        A*
        DFS 

    Is our graph dis-connected?
    Do we have negative cycles?
    Strongly connected components
