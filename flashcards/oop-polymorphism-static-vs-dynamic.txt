Static Polymorphism
 
	* occurs at compile time 
	* early binding process
	* faster
	* overloaded functions and templates that happen at compile time 
 	* Static Polymorphism is the linking of a function with an object during compile time is called static. It is also called static binding. C# provides two techniques to implement static polymorphism i.e. Function overloading and Operator overloading.
 
 Dynamic Polymorphism
 
	* occurs at runtime
	* late binding 
	* interfaces that happen at run-time
