=== BIG O ===

Big O notation is a mathmatical notation that descripbes the limiting behavior of a function the argument tends toward a particualr value or infinity.

We use Big O to describe the performance of an algorithm - how does it scale as data grows

Expressed as O(n)


O(1) - constant time. takes the same amount of time regardless of input size 

O(log n) - logarithmic time.

O(n) - linear time. 

O(n^2) - quadratic time.

O(2 ^ n) - exponential time.
