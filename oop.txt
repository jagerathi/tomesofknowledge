=== Object Oriented Programming (OOP) ===

Four Pillars

	* Encapsulation
	* Abstration
	* Inheritance
	* Polymorphism
	
Solution to procedural programming and spaghetti code

Encapulation

"The best functions are those with no parameters." - Robert Martin (Uncle Bob)

Abstration

 * Simpler Interface
 * Reduce the impact of change
 
Inheritance

 * allows you to eliminate redundant code 

Polymorphism

 * many forms 
 * eliminates if and case situations
 
 
Benefits

 * Encapsulation - Reduce complexity and increase reusablility
 * Abstrations - Reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes 
 * Inheritance - Eliminate redundant code 
 * Polymorphism - Refactor ugly switch/case statements
