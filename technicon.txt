DATA LAKE (https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/what-is-a-data-lake/)
    Description: A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. 
                 You can store your data as-is, without having to first structure the data, and run different types of analyticsâ€”from dashboards 
                 and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.
    Use Cases:
    Advantages: Schema on read. Low cost storage. Raw data. 
    Dis-Advantages:

ElasticSearch (elastic.co)
    Description: Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, 
                 numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. Elasticsearch is built on Apache Lucene and was first released in 2010 by 
                 Elasticsearch N.V. (now known as Elastic). Known for its simple REST APIs, distributed nature, speed, and scalability, Elasticsearch 
                 is the central component of the Elastic Stack, a set of open source tools for data ingestion, enrichment, storage, analysis, and visualization. 
                 Commonly referred to as the ELK Stack (after Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), the Elastic Stack now includes a rich collection of lightweight 
                 shipping agents known as Beats for sending data to Elasticsearch.

    Dis-Advantages:

Kibana
    Description: Kibana is a data visualization and management tool for Elasticsearch that provides real-time histograms, line graphs, pie charts, and maps. 
                 Kibana also includes advanced applications such as Canvas, which allows users to create custom dynamic infographics based on their data, 
                 and Elastic Maps for visualizing geospatial data.
    Use Cases: 
    Advantages:
    Dis-Advantages:

Logstash
    Description: Logstash, one of the core products of the Elastic Stack, is used to aggregate and process data and send it to Elasticsearch. 
                 Logstash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that enables you to ingest data from multiple sources simultaneously 
                 and enrich and transform it before it is indexed into Elasticsearch.
    Use Cases:

    Dis-Advantages:

MongoDB (mongodb.com)
    Description: MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.
    Use Cases: dynamic schema, document based data 
    Advantages: CRUD is atomic by default. 
    Dis-Advantages: 16-MB document size limit. Large documents mean more overhead and will impact performance. 

REDIS (redis.io)
    Description: Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. 
                 Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, 
                 geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, 
                 and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning 
                 with Redis Cluster.
    Use Cases: Session Cache, Full Page Cache, Queues, Leaderboards, Pub/Sub
