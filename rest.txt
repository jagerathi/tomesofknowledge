=== REST ===

https://restfulapi.net/

REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia 
systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation.

Like any other architectural style, REST also does have it’s own 6 guiding constraints which must 
be satisfied if an interface needs to be referred as RESTful. These principles are listed below.

*** 6 Guiding Principles ***

    1. Client-Server
    2. Stateless
    3. Cacheable
    4. Uniform interface
    5. Layered systems
    6. Code on demand (optional)

The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource

In simplest words, in the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources 
and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, 
well-defined operations. The clients and servers exchange representations of resources by using a 
standardized interface and protocol – typically HTTP.
