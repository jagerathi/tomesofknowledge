==== UNIT TESTING ====

* UNIT TEST = Tests a unit of an application without its external dependancies 

	* Cheap to write 
	* execute fast 
	
* INTEGRATION TEST = Tests the application with its external dependancies

	* take longer to execute 
	* give you more confidence in the health of your application 
	
* END-TO-END Test 

	* Drives an application through its UI 
	* Give you the greatest confidence 
	* Very slow 
	* Very brittle

		install-package NUnit3TestAdapter -Version 3.8.0
	* Test class is decorated with [TestFixture]
	* Test method is decorated with [Test]
	* Asset.That()
	
*** Conventions ***

	* Project name should be MainProjectName.UnitTests
	* Class name should match the class we are testing - Reservations would be ReservationTests 
	* Test setup - Triple A
