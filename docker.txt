Containers are a way to package software in a format that can run isolated on a shared operating system.
Unlike VMs, containers do not bundle a full operating system - only librairies and settings requeisted to make 
the software work are needed.
This makes for efficient, lightweight, self-contained systems that guarentees that software will always 
run the same, regardless of where it is deployed.

*** COMMANDS ****

exec - execute something on the docker instance (docker exec -it <instance name> <command>) [ docker exec -it root_owncloud1 bash ]
